This is the server for my reddit-clone frontend. 
It is made with Node.js/Express, 

JSONWebTokens for authentication and login status validation,

GraphQL for intuitive and seamless frontend development,

Apollo-server-express for easy integration of GraphQL while maintaining important features of express,

BCrypt for secure password storage and validation.

I have left my JS migration file in for posterity. Building a custom script to migrate from what was previously a Firebase backend was an incredible challenge and was very rewarding to accomplish.
